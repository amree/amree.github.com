meta-description: How to generate full referrer URL in the new Google Analytics
---

Most of the tutorial on the web focuses on the old version of Google Analytics. So, after poking around Google Analytics, I found out that there are two ways to see it (I stopped looking once I found the second method, so, there might be more).

1. Go to Custom Reporting tab.

1. Click Edit.

1. If you've already added a tab, just click "+add report tab" for this purpose.

1. Put the name of this report.

1. Choose Flat Table as the type.

1. For the Dimensions, search for Full Referrer.

1. For the Metrics, use Unique Visitors (or anything you see fits).

1. Click Save.

That's it. You can refer to the screenshot below if you're feeling lost:

Good luck!
