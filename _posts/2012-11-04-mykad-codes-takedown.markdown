Last month my colleague and I had a meeting with Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara. From that meeting I learned people at JPN are not really happy with the code to read MyKad available publicly on the Internet especially not in the Github due to some reasons which I don't think should be mentioned here.

Since I've posted those codes (from Xenon and myself) on the Github, I had to take them down permanently. IMHO I should respect their decision since it's not mine to begin with. I love how those codes have helped a lot of people especially students as they do not really have the sufficient funds to buy the expensive SDK. I would love to comment further on this decision, but I don't think I should :(.
